        <h1>About Ham-burger</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Tradition Since 1885</p>
        <p>Burgers can also be made with patties made from ingredients other than beef. For example, a turkey burger uses ground turkey meat, a chicken burger uses ground chicken meat. A buffalo burger uses ground meat from a bison, and an ostrich burger is made from ground seasoned ostrich meat.</p>
        <p>For more than a quarter of a century, Athens, Texas, has been boasting that the world's first hamburgers were created in the late 1880's at a small cafe on the Henderson County courthouse square run by a man known as Uncle Fletcher Davis.</p>
